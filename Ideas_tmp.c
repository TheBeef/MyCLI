Ideas I want in this prompt:
 x Multible prompts (different prompts on different ports at the same time) (don't think I can do this with passing around the handle, Don't think it's worth it)
 * Help system
 * TAB Auto complete (commands / args)
 * Different foot print CLI/prompts
 * Login system????
 * Command groups (Many command sets)???
 * Handle "'s in the input stream

Done:
 x Telnet Support
 x Setable prompt
 x Init / shutdown
 x Support for doing a autoexec.bat / batch file
